## What types of services are offered?
We provide algorithms and software development services to address your problems.
Examples of what we do include:

* Developing robust and efficient software for your sequencing experiments.
* Optimizing a tool that is bottlenecking your sequence analysis pipeline.
* Maintaining or adding new features to an existing open source tool.

## What is the typical consulting process?
1. You email us and get in touch.
2. We meet and discuss your problem.
3. If we decide to work together, then we work out details like deliverables and payment.

We like to start with a smaller, well-constrained project to minimize risk for both parties the first time we work together.

## Is Daniel Liu Consulting the right fit for your project?
Get in touch! We can meet and discuss whether we can help solve your problem!
We also encourage you to check out our [About](/about) page to learn more about our history of work.

## How are payments done?
For a single project, we typically bill by hour every week or month, with an upper limit on the duration of the project.
More work or other projects can be added depending on our availability.
